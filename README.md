# 📊 Bellabeat Wellness Analysis

This repository contains my analysis for the Bellabeat wellness technology case study, focusing on activity and sleep data to uncover insights and marketing recommendations.

## 💼 About the Project

As part of my portfolio, I explored smart device data to understand user behavior. Using R, I merged daily activity and sleep data, visualized relationships, and analyzed trends.

## 📁 Files Included

- `visualisation_wellness_project.pages`: Visual summaries of key findings.
- `dailyActivity_merged.csv`: Raw daily activity data.
- `sleepDay_merged.csv`: Raw sleep data.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Participants with higher sleep durations tend to have slightly fewer steps.
- There’s a weak negative relationship between total minutes asleep and total steps.
- Combining sleep and activity data provides a richer understanding of user patterns.

## 💡 Recommendations

- Promote features that encourage balanced activity and rest.
- Create marketing campaigns based on sleep and step trends.
- Use data-driven personalization to engage users.
